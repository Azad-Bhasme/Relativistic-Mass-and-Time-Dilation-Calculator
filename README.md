## 🚀 Relativistic Mass & Time Dilation Calculator


This interactive Python app demonstrates the mind-bending effects of **Einstein’s Special Relativity** by calculating:

* 🧪 **Relativistic mass** increase at high velocities
* 🕒 **Time dilation** experienced by astronauts traveling to distant stars

Whether you're a space enthusiast or a curious learner, this app helps you **visualize how motion near the speed of light affects mass and time**!


### 🔍 What It Does

* 📈 Calculates **relativistic mass** using the Lorentz factor
* 🌌 Simulates **interstellar journeys** to stars like Alpha Centauri and Betelgeuse
* 👨‍🚀 Shows how astronauts experience **shorter time** compared to observers on Earth
* 🎛️ Interactive slider to control speed as a percentage of light
