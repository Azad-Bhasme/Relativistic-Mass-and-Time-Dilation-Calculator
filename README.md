# Relativistic-Mass-and-Time-Dilation-Calculator
This Python script calculates the relativistic mass of a spaceship and the time experienced by astronauts when traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light. It uses Einsteinâ€™s theory of special relativity to demonstrate how velocity affects mass and time perception during interstellar travel.
